Just another contact form plugin. Simple but flexible.

== Description ==

This modified version extends the multiple recipient select that comes with Contact Form 7:

`<p>Department<br/>
[select recipient "General Contact|test1@test.com" "Programs/Services Information|test2@test.com" 
 "Support|test3@test.com"]</p>`

And allows you to:

- Retrieve the label (i.e: General Contact) of the recipient the user selected with a shortage:

`[recipient-label]`

- If you need to send the visitor a custom response depending on the recipient they selected, you can do it with:

`[response-test1@test.com]

This is response 1.

[/response-test1@test.com]

[response-test2@test.com]

This is response 2

meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh

[/response-test2@test.com]

[response-test3@test.com]

This is response 3.

[/response-test3@test.com]`


Maybe not the best way to do it, but it works.
